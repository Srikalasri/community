    <h3>Education And Awareness</h3>
    <h1>INTRODUCTION :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Women‘s empowerment in India is heavily dependent on many different variables that include
        geographical location (urban/rural), educational status, social status (caste and class), and age.
        Policies on women‘s empowerment exist at the national, state, and local (Panchayat) levels in many
        sectors, including health, education, economic opportunities, gender-based violence, and politicalparticipation. 
        However, there are significant gaps between policy advancements and actual practiceat the community level.
        One key factor for the gap in implementation of laws and policies to address discrimination,economic disadvantages, 
        and violence against women at the community level is the largelypatriarchal structure that governs the community and 
        households in much of India. As such, womenand girls have restricted mobility, access to education, access to health 
        facilities, and lower decision-making power, and experience higher rates of violence. 
        Political participation is also hindered at thePanchayat (local governing bodies) level 
        and at the state and national levels, despite existingreservations for women.

    <h1>Good Touch And Bad Touch :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Good touch feels caring, like a pat on the head, back, 
        or a bear hug. In comparison, a bad touch can hurt your 
        body or feelings, such as pinching, hitting, or touching 
        any private area. Let children know that it's ok to say 
        no if you don't like any touch, even from a friend or a 
        family member.Good touch is any kind of physical contact 
        that makes someone feel safe and comfortable. This can include hugs, high-fives, and pats on the back. On the other hand, bad touch is any kind of physical contact that makes someone feel uncomfortable or scared.

    <h1>Victim Blaming :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Victim-blaming norms and violence against women: Moral considerations 
        can induce policy and behaviour change
        Sevinc Bermek  Asli Unan / 8 Mar 2024
        Violence against women entails great psychological, 
        physical, and socioeconomic costs. Prevailing victim-blaming norms 
        are an impediment to social change. This column uses an experiment to 
        uncover the different behavioural mechanisms that drive policy and 
        attitudinal change and are working in a complementary fashion. 
        The findings are good news for introducing welfare-improving social 
        change as they suggest a stepping-stone approach to changing policy 
        and norms regarding gender-based violence.

    <h1>Economic Empowerment :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        The report defines economic violence as “any action or omission aimed 
        at economic abuse or abusive control of finances, monetary rewards, or 
        punishments of women due to their social, economic, or political condition.” 
        Economic violence can occur in partner, family, work, or economic relationships.
        While gender-based violence is often associated with physical or sexual acts, economic 
        violence is a critically important part of the picture.

    <h1>Conclusion :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Women are having the power to change the world. A strong woman wears their pain like they do stilettos. The prevention, elimination and reduction of women again violence must be done by understanding and anticipating the gender impacts of various political and economic policies and forces. And the major treatment and prevention interventions, such as child maltreatment systems, casework, protective orders, and health care the victims of domestic violence, battered women’s shelters, elder abuse interventions, of all the types, have not been the subjects of rigorous evaluation studies. All the men and boys should respect girls and women in schools, in colleges, in workplaces, places of worships, at home and the streets.
