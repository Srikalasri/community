    <h3>Voilence Against Women</h3>
    <h1>INTRODUCTION :</h1>
    <p class="para">

        Violence against women does not mean only physical violence. It is much broader and includes sexual, emotional, psychological and financial abuse. The National Plan targets two main types of violence against women – domestic and family violence, and sexual assault.
        <br><br>
        On an international level, the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women provides the following definition:
        <br><br>
        ‘The term violence against women means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life.’

    <h1>Domestic Voilence :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Domestic violence can be physical, emotional, verbal, economic and sexual abuse.
        Domestic violence can be subtle, coercive or violent. As politician Renuka Chowdhury says, in India, 70% of women are victims of domestic violence.
        The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in 2016 uncovered a concerning aspect: a substantial 86% of Indian women who experienced domestic violence chose not to disclose their ordeal, refraining from sharing it with friends or family members. This silence is intricately tied to the victims' internalization of social norms, leading them to believe that they are inadequate as wives and, consequently, deserving of the inflicted punishment.

    <h1>Forced Child Marraige :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Young girls face a heightened susceptibility to coerced early marriages, confronting a dual vulnerability owing to their status as both children and females. The plight of child brides is exacerbated by their limited comprehension of the significance and obligations associated with marriage. The factors contributing to such early unions encompass the prevailing perception that girls represent a burden on their parents, coupled with the apprehension that they might compromise their chastity prior to marriage. This multifaceted issue underscores the urgent need for comprehensive interventions and awareness programs to address the root causes and consequences of child marriages, recognizing the unique challenges faced by young girls caught in this distressing phenomenon.

    <h1>Psycological Abuse :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Psychological abuse, often called emotional abuse, is a form of abuse characterized by a person subjecting or exposing another person to a behavior that may result in psychological trauma, including anxiety, chronic depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder amongst other psychological problems.
        According to current research the terms "psychological abuse" and "emotional abuse" can be used interchangeably, unless associated with psychological violence.[5] More specifically, "emotional abuse" is any abuse that is emotional rather than physical. It can include anything from verbal abuse and constant criticism to more subtle tactics such as intimidation, manipulation, and refusal to ever be pleased. This abuse occurs when someone uses words or actions to try and control the other person, to keep someone afraid or isolated, or try to break someone's self-esteem.
