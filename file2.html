        <p class="para">

            Violence against women does not mean only physical violence. It is much broader and includes sexual, emotional, psychological and financial abuse. The National Plan targets two main types of violence against women – domestic and family violence, and sexual assault.

Such violence is often considered a form of hate crime, committed against women or girls specifically because they are female, and can take many forms.

        <p class="para">
            Today, the safety of women in India is widely discussed everywhere. Now it has become a serious problem. The crime rate is skyrocketing. Women are not safe either at home or outside. Female travelers from other countries also find themselves in a precarious position when traveling to India. But these fears cannot stop them from any social activity. There are laws, but there must be adequate security measures that must be strictly followed to protect against violence against women.
