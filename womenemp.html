    <h1 class="head">Women Empowerment</h1>
    <h1>INTRODUCTION :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        As a progressive society, standing for women's rights and empowerment, 
        we must stop viewing culture only as a barrier and an obstacle to women's 
        rights.Culture is an integral and huge part of diversity and a medium 
        that seeks to ensure women's equal opportunities. It recognises their 
        freedom to take pride in their values, whether they are orthodox or 
        modern in nature. This is not to say that centuries of abuse clothed 
        in the spirit of culture should be allowed to continue, let alone be 
        celebrated. Undoubtedly, traditions cloaked in the idea of empowerment 
        should be objected to in light of feminism. For example, some research 
        indicates that women only have an equal chance to have their written work 
        published in peer-reviewed journals if the sex of the author is absolutely 
        unknown to the reviewers. This is a result of historical habitual culture 
        which has led to lack of representation of women in literary and therefore, 
        strongly demonstrated why all cultural legacies cannot and should not be 
        celebrated or encouraged.

    <h1>Barriers :</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Many of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity are the result 
        of cultural norms. While many women are aware of the issues posed by gender 
        inequality, others have become accustomed to it.Many men in power are 
        hesitant to disrupt societal norms that are unfair to women.

        Research shows that the increasing access to the Internet can also 
        result in an increased exploitation of women.Releasing personal information 
        on websites has put some women's personal safety at risk. In 2010, Working 
        to Halt Online Abuse stated that 73% of women were victimized through such 
        sites. Types of victimization include cyber stalking, harassment, online 
        pornography, flaming, and especially sexual harassment in the workplace. 
        It occurs most frequently in business, trade, banking and finance, sales 
        and marketing, hospitality, civil service, lecturing, teaching, and education.
